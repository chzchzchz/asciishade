### What is shade?

Shade is an upcoming ASCII creation and editing tool.
It is written from the ground up in Python using the curses library.

### Why write shade?

Highly dissatisfied with the complete lack of options in the ascii-creation department, I decided to begin implementing a pure CLI tool. I began writing shade late at night on April 30th, 2022. It was easier than expected to get something close to what I wanted right-away. Now is just about fine-tuning the system.

The state of developers online is largely sided towards web applications. I admire the simplicity and purity of CLI and 'tui' tools and programs. They can often perform much better than their web counterparts.
